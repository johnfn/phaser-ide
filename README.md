# phaser/typescript boilerplate

It's a little annoying to get Phaser and Typescript set up for the first time. This should make the process go a little smoother.

## how to get started:

First time:

    bower install jquery
    bower install backbone
    bower install phaser

Every time:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    tsc --watch src/*.ts
